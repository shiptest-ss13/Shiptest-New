	"description": "The Typhon-Class is a robust conversion of an old miner-freighter, seeing employment by the Colonial Militia as a fast-response vessel against smaller pirate holdings, whilst it's spacious cargo decks enable relatively long-term deployment for it's crew size and the facilities needed to maintain an exosuit in working condition. The vessel commonly sees deployment in fringe sectors with a goal to combat pirate activity. The Typhon began it's service around the year 400 FSC. However, it's production only truly began after the Colonial Militia liberated Lanchester City. During the Frontiersmen War, the ship primarly acted as an escort for larger vessels.",
